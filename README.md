# Frontend Mentor - Newsletter sign-up form with success message solution

This is a solution to the Newsletter sign-up form with success message challenge on Frontend Mentor. This project helped me practice form validation, DOM manipulation, and responsive layout using basic frontend technologies.

---

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Enter their email address and submit the form
- See a success message after submitting a valid email
- See validation error messages for:
  - Empty input
  - Invalid email format
- View a responsive layout on different screen sizes
- See hover effects on interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- Mobile-first workflow

---

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned how to:

- Validate email input using JavaScript and regular expressions
- Show and hide UI sections dynamically using `display` property
- Handle user events using `addEventListener`
- Debug issues related to image paths and GitHub Pages deployment
- Properly structure project folders for deployment

This project also helped me understand how hosting environments handle file paths differently.

---

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to improve:

- Writing cleaner and reusable JavaScript logic using functions
- Improving accessibility (ARIA labels, focus states)
- Better project structure and naming conventions
- Using Git and GitHub more confidently with version control

---

### Useful resources

- Frontend Mentor documentation  
- MDN Web Docs  
- GitHub Pages documentation  

These resources helped me understand form validation, DOM manipulation, and deployment.
